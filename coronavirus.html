			The year 2020 is perhaps the worst of times in world history. The invisible enemy in the form COVID-19 has attacked the entire world. This pandemic has proved to be a much stronger and more efficient machinery than the two world wars in causing mass-scale destruction of human lives. The microscopic organism named Corona Virus has silently been successful in doing what perhaps the much-dreaded third world war would not have been able to do had it taken place by now. The virus has spread so widely around the world that it has more than 33 lakh confirmed cases as of 8th May, 2020. 
				</p>
	
				<p>
			However, considering the positive aspect of this, it has to be acknowledged that the entire world has united to stand up and fight against this common enemy of mankind. People have realised the value of human life and political leaders across the globe have agreed to work upon a common plan of action, irrespective of national boundaries or ideological differences. This invisible yet powerful weapon of mass destruction has pointed out the helplessness of all the armies of the world. World leaders are fighting against this pandemic together. For example – Indian Prime Minister assured the Thai Prime Minister of India’s commitment to support the pharmaceutical requirements of Thailand.
				</p>
				<p>
				Whether one believes it or not, God has already chalked out his masterplan and this was destined to be. The rapid progress of human civilization with the development of science and technology has brought about drastic changes in the way of life, thereby deviating from the path of nature and the original creation of God. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The covid-19 pandemic has suddenly created a pause in the maddening rat race of life. The urge for earning money in order to lead a luxurious life has led to cut-throat competition in the field of education and employment. The twentieth and twenty-first centuries have been characterized by soaring ambition to reach to the top in one’s individual field of life and set a benchmark in the society. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In this endeavour of rising to the top and craving a niche for oneself in the society, one has lost contact with nature and has parted from one’s own family. Many of us have travelled to distant places of the world either for official work or just to spend a holiday. How many of us had the time to stop and stare at the beautiful sight of a dewdrop on a blade of grass just outside our doorstep?
				</p>
				<p>
				The long period of “Lockdown” imposed by the governments of the various countries has not only been able to control the spread of Corona Virus but also been instrumental in bringing people close to nature and their family members. The “Lockdown” has forced people to stay at home, thereby spending quality time with family. During this period of Lockdown, people have got the opportunity of listening to the chirping of birds, feeling the touch of the gentle breeze, watching a flower bloom in the pot and inhaling the pollution free air. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Moreover, people have realized the dignity of labour and that each and every occupation is essential in life. We have understood that people like the grocer, the milkman, the plumber and the farmer are indispensable in our lives. This has brought about a feeling of harmony and inter-dependence in the society. In the face of death, all religions, castes and communities merge into one and people act as if the whole world is one country and mankind its citizens. Therefore, the year 2020 may be considered the best of times in the recent past only if, by God’s grace we manage to overcome the threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.
