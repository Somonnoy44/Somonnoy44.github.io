			A summary of the industrial growth in India in the last 2-3 years has been mentioned in this paragraph. The general index of industrial production (IIP) in March 2018 was 140.3 while it was 144.1 in the month of March 2019. The index of industrial production witnessed a sharp decline of 16.7 percent which took the index to 120.1 in the month of March 2020.  The fall in IIP during March was mainly because to the effects of the national lockdown imposed due to Covid-19. In March last year, the manufacturing sector had witnessed a growth of 3.1 per cent. During the same period the mining sector had grown at 0.8 per cent and the electricity sector had shown a growth of 2.2 per cent.  The output of 8 core industries declined in November 2019 compared to October 2018.  India’s core sector displayed a weak performance as it grew just 0.6% in FY20 falling behind by a 4.4% rise in FY19.

	Comments by various personalities in India on Budget 2020 regarding industrial growth is given in this paragraph. “Budget didn’t meet auto industry expectations. The Indian automobile industry was looking forward to some direct benefits in the budget, which could have helped in reviving demand in the context of the current slowdown and huge investments made by the Industry for transition to BS-6 and from that aspect, the Budget speech was not what we were expecting.” (Rajan Wadhera, SIAM)  “A farsighted budget, it is commendable that the FM has announced a innovative initiative that will enhance ease of living, improve the health quotient and boost opportunities for education and job creation, for all sections of the society and meet the expectations of an aspirational India.” (Prathap C. Reddy, Apollo Hospitals Group Chairman) “Amidst global turbulence and the nations dealing with bushfires and the coronavirus, Ms. Sitaraman has looked to craft a granular long term strategy to focus on vital issues.” (Harsh Goenka, RPG enterprises chairman) “Directionally, it is a sound budget and I am happy to see the government’s focus on reviving economic growth.” (Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Biocon CMD) “Prepaid smart metering and freedom to choose power supplier will lay the ground to bring competition in the power sector and give consumers a choice.” (Santosh Kamath, Partner and Leader, KPMG India) “The Finance Minister stays committed to beat critics by announcing a digital refund of duties and taxes to exporters. This will go a long way in swaying India to be an export-oriented economy and will massively tilt the balance of foreign exchange favourably.” (Anil Talreja, Deloitte India) With a thrust on talent, technology and entrepreneurship, Budget 2020-21 is a promising budget in support of making India’s $5 trillion economy dream come true. It is heartening to see initiatives that are aimed at enhancing digital penetration in the country by making Fibre to the home (FTTH) accessible to 100,000 Gram Panchayats via Bharat Net, which will go a long way in bridging the digital divide. Also, the decision to build data centre parks for the private sector is 
another step towards making India a data economy superpower. Furthermore, strategic initiatives aimed at leveraging new-age technologies like the Internet-of-Things, machine learning, robotics, bioinformatics, quantum computing and artificial intelligence across sectors will further help in laying the foundation of a robust, digital economy.” (CP Gurnani, MD & CEO, Tech Mahindra) “We find Union Budget 2020 to be a reasonable one with strong measures and good intent. Tax benefit for the middle class makes life easier for the common man and leaves more money in the hands of the consumer. Decriminalization in the Companies Act is a major positive that Corporate India will welcome. No reduction in GST rate for vehicles is a dampener for us.” (Mr Sharad Malhotra, President, Nippon Paint India)

	My view of budget 2020 is first of all, simplifying the tax slab is a good initiative by the government as it would encourage investments. By lowering the income tax, middle income group would have more income to purchase goods and buy residential houses which implies growth of the real estate industry. Small cities which come under Tier II and Tier III will get benefitted as the government has decided to put ₹100 lakh crore.  (MOF, 2020) “We need to expand the base for knowledge-driven enterprises. Intellectual property creation and protection will play an important role. Several measures are proposed in this regard, which will benefit the start-ups.” (Minister of Finance, Budget Speech) Thus, it is a positive step by the government which recognised the role of start-ups in industrial growth. The government proposed to provide early life funding, including a seed fund to support ideation and development of early stage start-ups. This is a welcome move by the government of India to support Indian entrepreneurs. In order to provide boost to the manufacturing sector, new provisions were introduced in September 2019 offering a concessional corporate tax rate of 15% to the newly incorporated domestic companies in the manufacturing sector which start manufacturing by 31st March, 2023, this is a good incentive to the manufacturing industries however, this will mean loss of revenue for the government but employment opportunities will be available more to the Indian youth. The abolition of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) is a relief for the middle and lower class people and for the auto-sector companies and the overall market. However, there were certain expectations which were not met in the union budget as stated by Mr, Wadhera, etc.

This paragraph consists of the conclusion on the given matter. I believe that Budget 2020 has a good number of positives, but it won’t be able to ensure complete industrial growth in 2020. A big reason for the same is the outbreak of Covid-19. This has completely changed the dynamics of the industrial growth and the provisions suggested by the government to ensure industrial growth gets hampered. Data released by the industry department on Thursday showed sectors including crude oil (-5.5%), natural gas (-15.2%), refinery products (-0.5%), fertilizers (-11.9%), steel (-13%), cement (-24.7%) and electricity (-7.2%) saw a contraction in output in the month, except coal which grew 4%.   “With the lockdown in place throughout April, which is expected to have severely curtailed production in many core sectors, the contraction in core sector output is likely to worsen to alarming levels in that month. For instance, the lockdown has curtailed the demand for electricity by a considerable ~24% till April 27,"  (Aditi Nayar, principal economist, Icra Ltd.) Thus, I believe budget 2020 had certain provisions to ensure industrial growth but were not meeting the expectations of several economists and with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, it is evident that budget 2020 won’t be sufficient to ensure industrial growth in the country.
